# DeepLGR: Revisiting Convolutional Neural Networks for Citywide Crowd Flow Analytics. 
In this study, we have revisited the CNN approaches for citywide crowd flow analytics and identified the drawbacks of existing arts. To overcome these challenges, we present a new framework named DeepLGR.

*This is an easy implement of DeepLGR using Pytorch 1.1.0, tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with a RTX 2080Ti GPU.*
